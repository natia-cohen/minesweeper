## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (optional for contributors).

2. Open the project directory:

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the game.

## Usage

- Choose the difficulty level (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert).
- Click on cells to reveal them.
